Game of Life in Scala

early alpha - prepare a canvas of alive and dead cells in a form of a newline separated string of 1's and 0's and use with the GameOfLife app.
Game is displayed in a console, use any key to advance a stage.

future plans:
	web presentation layer using javascript canvas/Play
	spike several javascript visualisation libraries
	presentation to show a shadow of a previous state (smooth transitions)
	improved algorithms to calculate large/semi-infinite game canvases
