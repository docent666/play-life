Game of Life in Scala

alpha - prepare a canvas of alive and dead cells in a form of a newline separated string of 1's and 0's and use with the GameOfLife app.
Game is displayed in a console, use any key to advance a stage.
Simple visualisation added in a work-in-progress web page: use ./activator run and http://localhost:9000

future plans:
	web presentation layer using javascript canvas/Play - cleanup
	proper state handling
	canvas/javascript presentation to show a shadow of a previous state (smooth transitions)
	improved algorithms to calculate large/semi-infinite game canvases
	3d life (life sphere)
